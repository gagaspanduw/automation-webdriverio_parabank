    7.8.0:
        Changes:  changes in webdriverio reporting broke the cucumber support.
                   handlebars is not capable of supporting the recursion needed to 
                   render a suite that contains suites.
                   Had to switch to numjucks to have cucumber work.
                   As a result you can no longer supply your own template file.
                   Cucumber has nested suites in suites and duplicated data.
                   Had to work around that.
